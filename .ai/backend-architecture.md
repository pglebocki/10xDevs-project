# Backend API Architecture Plan

## Overview
The backend API for the GitHub Developer Activity Dashboard is designed to serve data efficiently from GitHub while ensuring consistency, error handling, and maintainability. This plan leverages Node, TypeScript, Express, and caching strategies to deliver a robust service that meets the product requirements.

## Key Features & Functional Requirements
- Proxy and cache GitHub REST API data.
- Support multiple metrics with a primary focus on timeline visualization for PRs.
- Enable developer selection to display tailored PR data and detailed metrics on hover.

## Technology Stack Alignment
- **Backend Framework:** Node + TypeScript + Express
- **GitHub Integration:** Octokit/rest for GitHub API communications, using tokens for authentication.
- **Caching:** In-memory caching or Redis (for scaling) to cache fetched GitHub data and reduce rate limit issues.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement Express middleware for uniform error responses and logging.

## Architectural Layers
1. **Routing & Controller Layer**
   - Define RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/health`, `/repositories`, `/metrics/timeline`).
   - Validate incoming requests and invoke the appropriate service methods.
   - Ensure a consistent response format: `{ data: any, error: null }` for success, or error details if applicable.

2. **Service/Business Logic Layer**
   - Handle core business logic such as data transformation from GitHub responses into metrics suitable for timeline visualization.
   - Implement logic for developer filtering and metric view switching.
   - Use guard clauses and early returns for error handling.

3. **Data Access & Integration Layer**
   - Manage external communications with the GitHub REST API using Octokit.
   - Integrate caching strategies to store and refresh GitHub data at set intervals.
   - Encapsulate API authentication details securely via environment variables.

4. **Error Handling & Logging Layer**
   - Use global error handling middleware to capture and log errors consistently.
   - Return standardized error messages with proper HTTP status codes.
   - Implement logging mechanisms for operational monitoring and debugging.

## Consistent Response & Error Formats
- All endpoints return responses in a consistent format:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": <any>,
    "error": null
  }
  ```
  or in case of error:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "data": null,
    "error": {
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "message": "Descriptive error message."
    }
  }
  ```
- Validation errors and unexpected exceptions are handled immediately with appropriate status codes and messages.

## Caching Strategy
- Integrate a caching layer to store GitHub API responses, reducing latency and API rate limit issues.
- The caching service will automatically refresh data at defined intervals, ensuring up-to-date information on PR statuses.

## Implementation Considerations & Assumptions
- The list of repositories is static and hardcoded as per the PRD requirements.
- Future endpoints for developer-specific data can be added, leveraging the existing service and integration patterns.
- Security considerations include safe handling of GitHub tokens and using environment variables for authentication.
- API scalability and maintainability are ensured by a clear separation of concerns among layers and consistent error handling mechanisms.

## Directory Structure
The backend code follows a modular structure aligned with the overall project guidelines. The main sections include:

- **/src** - Contains all source code:
  - `/src/controllers`: Contains controllers that handle HTTP request validations and responses.
  - `/src/services`: Implements business logic for interacting with the GitHub API, data transformation, and caching.
  - `/src/routes`: Defines Express routing to group related endpoints.
  - `/src/config`: Stores configuration files including environment variable settings and constants.

## Conclusion
This architecture plan outlines a robust and scalable approach to building the backend API for the GitHub Developer Activity Dashboard. By adhering to a layered architecture, consistent response formats, effective caching strategies, and comprehensive error handling, the API will be well-equipped to support current and future product requirements.
